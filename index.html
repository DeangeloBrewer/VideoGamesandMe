<p>On this website, I will be talking about my passion for video games and where this passion came from.
I will also be giving a brief summary of the history of video games for those unfamiliar with the topic.</p>

<h2 id="history">A Brief History of Video Games</h2>
<p>While video games today are found in homes worldwide, the history of video games began in science labs in the early 1950s. Video games back then was much more simpler back then, with games such as 3D tic-tac-toe and pong.</p>

<p>Video games did not gain popularity in the mainstream market until the 1970s and 80s. In 1983 however, the North American video game industry experienced a "crash" due to several factors. This included, but was not limited to, a oversaturation of video game market console, and a abundance of low quality games being released.
The industry began to recover in 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) came to the United States. The NES improved on several things over the previous consoles such as 8-bit graphics, colors, sound and gameplay. Since then, video games has became a popular form of entertainment all around the world.</p>

<h2 id="generations">Console Generations</h2>

<p>Video games have gone through several generations throughout the years. I'll be listing some of my favorites from each generation.</p>
<p>Special note: Ever since the development and widespread use of smartphones, mobile gaming has been a emerging industry for games, as they can reach people formerly uninterested in gaming, and those unable to afford or support dedicated hardware, such as video game consoles or gaming PCs.</p>
