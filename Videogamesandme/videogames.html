<h1>My Introduction to Video Games</h1>
<p>The first system that I played video games on wasn't on the aforementioned consoles that I went over, but on a portable handheld called the Game Boy Advanced SP.</p>

<p>I don't have too many memories of the time when I had it due to how young I was at the time, but it would have a lasting impact on how I chose to entertain myself throughout my life, and one day, develop a career in developing software for the games I love to play.</p>
