<h1>My Introduction to Video Games</h1>
<p>The first system that I played video games on wasn't on the aforementioned consoles that I went over, but on a portable handheld called the Game Boy Advanced SP.</p>

<p>I don't have too many memories of the time when I had it due to how young I was at the time, but it would have a lasting impact on how I chose to entertain myself throughout my life, and one day, develop a career in developing software for the games I love to play.</p>

<h2>Why I Love Video Games</h2>
<p>One day, while I was gaming, my mom suddenly came in my room and asked me,"Why do you love video games so much?" That question was something I thought about often, but never but too much thought into it because gaming was simply apart of my life.
    The reason why I love gaming so much is because I feel it is a good escape from the stress of the real world. Action-games tend to be my favrorite genre because running around and beating stuff up, or getting sucked in to an immersive world with good storytelling has always been a good stress reliever for me.
</p>
<p>Another reason I love gaming so much is because of the feeling of aaccomplishment. The feeling I get when I complete a difficult challenge in a video game is extremely satisfying and makes me want to play more.
    Violent video games in particular, tends to be perfect for letting anger out when you don't want to unleash it on someone you know. I like violent games in gerneral because they help us get out my frustrations in a healthy way.</p>

<p>Video games are a unique form of art that deserves more respect from the people who tend to criticize it. If someone ever criticize you for liking video games, don't worry about it; people tend to criticize things they know little to nothing about. Be glad, as a gamer, that you can experiance one of the most unique and beautiful art forms in the world.</p>
